<h2 class='nobreak' id='t102'>VIEW OF HUDSON CITY AND THE CATSKILL MOUNTAINS.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-longline.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:20%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span> WEDGE-SHAPED promontory, or bluff, pushes forward to the river at
this spot; and on its summit, which widens into a noble plain, stands
the city of Hudson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is supposed that the “Halve-Mane,” the vessel in which the great discoverer
made his first passage up the Hudson, reached no farther than two
leagues above the city which bears his name, and that the remainder of the
exploring voyage was made in the shallop. His reception here was in the
highest degree hospitable. “He went on shore in one of their canoes, with
an old Indian, who was the chief of forty men and seventeen women: these
he saw in a house made of the bark of trees, exceedingly smooth and well-finished
within and without. He found a great quantity of Indian corn and
beans, enough of which were drying near the house to have loaded three
ships, besides what was growing in the fields. On coming to the house two
mats were spread to sit on, eatables were brought in, in red bowls well
made, and two men were sent off with bows and arrows, who soon returned
with two pigeons. They also killed a fat dog, and skinned it with shells.
They expected their visitors would remain during the night, but the latter
determined to return on board. The natives were exceedingly kind and good-tempered;
for when they discovered Hudson’s determination to proceed on
board, they, imagining it proceeded from fear of their bows and arrows, broke
them to pieces and threw them into the fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return down the river, Hudson stopped again for four days opposite
the site of the future city. The historical collections give a very particular
account of every day’s movements in this interesting voyage. “On the
report of those whom he had sent to explore the river,” says the historian,
“Hudson found that it would be useless to proceed with his ship any farther,
or to delay his return. He had passed several days in a profitable traffic and
a friendly intercourse with the natives, among whom were probably those
from each side of the river,—the Mahicanni, as well as the Mohawks. At
noon of the 23d of September, he therefore went down six miles to a shoal;
having but little wind, the tide laid his ship on the bar until the flood came,
when she crossed it, and was anchored for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next day, after proceeding seven or eight leagues, she grounded on
a bank of ooze in the middle of the river, where she was detained till the
ensuing morning, when the flood, at ten o’clock, enabled Hudson to anchor
her in deep water. Thus the ship once more was interrupted in her passage
opposite the spot where a city now commemorates the name of
Hudson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here he remained, by reason of adverse winds, four days. On the day
of his arrival ‘they went on land and gathered good store of chestnuts,’
but whether on the east or west side of the river is not mentioned. But
the day following they went on land ‘to walk on the west side of the
river, and found good ground for corn and other garden herbs, with good
store of goodly oaks and walnut-trees, and chestnut-trees, yew-trees, and trees
of sweet wood in great abundance, and great store of <span class='it'>slate for houses and
other good stones</span>.’ Nothing is said of any inhabitants while they were thus
visiting the site, which is now that of the village of Athens, opposite Hudson.
But next morning (26th), after the carpenter, mate, and four of the
company had gone on shore to cut wood, while the vessel lay at anchor,
two canoes came up the river from the place where they first found ‘loving
people’ (Catskill landing); and in one of them was the old chief whom
Hudson had caused to be made intoxicated at Albany. He had followed
our strange visitors thirty miles, to the base of the Catskill Mountains, with
the double view of again testifying to Hudson the sincerity of his friendship,
and of gratifying the love of the marvellous, by relating his own
adventures to the mountaineers, and drawing them from their retreat to
witness the floating phenomenon. The old chief now introduced with him
‘an old man, who brought more stropes of beads and gave them to our
master, and showed him all the country thereabout, as though it were at
his command!’ They tarried, greatly pleased with the unaccountable curiosities
they discovered on board. Hudson ‘made the two old men dine
with him, and the old man’s wife; for they brought two old women and
two young maidens of the age of sixteen or seventeen years with them, who
behaved themselves very modestly.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After dinner, and upon exchange of presents, the guests retired, inviting
Hudson by signs to come down to them; for the ship was within two leagues
of the place where they dwelt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concluding circumstances of this interesting return down the Hudson,
will accompany another view in the series.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>LMOST any land looks beautiful after a long voyage; and it would not
be surprising if the Narrows, oftenest seen and described by those who
have just come off the passage of the Atlantic, should have this reputation.
It does not require an eye long deprived of verdure, however, to relish the
bold shores, the bright green banks, the clustering woods, and tasteful villas
which make up the charms of this lovely strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Busier waters than the Narrows could scarcely be found; and it is difficult
to imagine, amid so much bustle and civilization, the scene that presented
itself to Hendrick Hudson, when the little “Halve-Mane” stole in on her
voyage of discovery two hundred years ago. <span class='it'>Hoofden</span>, or the Highlands, as
he then named the hills in this neighborhood, “were covered with grass and
wild-flowers, and the air was filled with fragrance.” Groups of friendly natives,
clothed in elk-skins, stood on the beach, singing and offering him welcome;
and anchoring his little bark, he explored with his boats the channel
and inlets, and penetrated to the mouth of the river which was destined to
bear his name. It appears, however, that the Indians on the Long Island
side were less friendly; and in one of the excursions into the Bay of Manhattan
his boat was attacked by a party of twenty-nine savages of a ferocious
tribe, and an English sailor, named Colman, was killed by an arrow-shot in
the shoulder. Other unfriendly demonstrations from the same tribe induced
Hudson to leave his anchorage at Sandy Hook, and he drew in to the Bay
of New York, which he found most safe and commodious, and where he
still continued his intercourse with the Indians of Staten Island, receiving
them on board his vessel, dressing them, to their extravagant delight, in red
coats, and purchasing from them fish and fruits in abundance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this day there stands a villa on every picturesque point; a thriving
town lies on the left shore; hospitals and private sanitary establishments
extend their white edifices in the neighborhood of the quarantine-ground; and
between the little fleets of merchantmen, lying with the yellow flag at their
peak, fly rapidly and skilfully a constant succession of steamboats, gaily
painted and beautifully modelled, bearing on their airy decks the population of
one of the first cities of the world. Yet of Manhattan Island, on which New
York is built, Hudson writes, only two hundred years ago, that “it was wild
and rough; a thick forest covered the parts where anything would grow; its
beach was broken and sandy, and full of inlets; its interior presented hills of
stony and sandy alluvion, masses of rock, ponds, swamps, and marshes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gay description which an American would probably give of the Narrows,—the
first spot of his native land seen after a tedious voyage,—would
probably be in strong contrast with the impression it produces on the emigrant,
who sees in it only the scene of his first difficult step in a land of
exile. I remember noting this contrast with some emotion, on board the
packet-ship in which I was not long ago a passenger from England. Among
the crowd of emigrants in the steerage was the family of a respectable and
well-educated man, who had failed as a merchant in some small town in
England, and was coming, with the wreck of his fortune, to try the backwoods
of America. He had a wife and eight or ten very fine children, the
eldest of whom, a delicate and pretty girl of eighteen, had contributed to sustain
the family under their misfortunes at home by keeping a village school.
The confinement had been too much for her, and she was struck with consumption,—a
disease which is peculiarly fatal in America. Soon after leaving
the British Channel, the physician on board reported her to the captain as
exceedingly ill, and suffering painfully from the close air of the steerage; and
by the general consent of the cabin passengers a bed was made up for her
in the deck-house, where she received the kindest attention from the ladies
on board; and with her gentle manners and grateful expressions of pleasure
soon made an interest in all hearts. As we made the land, the air became
very close and hot; and our patient, perhaps from sympathy with the general
excitement about her, grew feverish and worse, hourly. Her father and a
younger sister sat by her, holding her hands and fanning her; and when we
entered the Narrows with a fair wind, and every one on board, forgetting her
in their admiration of the lovely scene, mounted to the upper deck, she was
raised to the window, and stood with the bright red spot deepening on her
cheek, watching the fresh green land without the slightest expression of
pleasure. We dropped anchor, the boats were lowered, and as the steerage
passengers were submitted to a quarantine, we attempted to take leave of her
before going on shore. A fit of the most passionate tears, the paroxysms of
which seemed almost to suffocate her, prevented her replying to us; and we
left that poor girl surrounded by her weeping family, trying in vain to
comfort her. Hers were feelings, probably, which are often associated with a
remembrance of the Narrows.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='t477'>VIEW FROM WEST POINT, HUDSON RIVER.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-longline.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0007' style='width:20%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>F the river scenery of America, the Hudson at West Point is doubtless
the boldest and most beautiful. This powerful river writhes through
the Highlands in abrupt curves, reminding one, when the tide runs strongly
down, of Laocoön in the enlacing folds of the serpent. The different spurs of
mountain ranges which meet here, abut upon the river in bold precipices from
five to fifteen hundred feet from the water’s edge; the foliage hangs to them,
from base to summit, with the tenacity and bright verdure of moss; and the
stream below, deprived of the slant lights which brighten its depths elsewhere,
flows on with a sombre and dark-green shadow on its bosom, as if frowning
at the narrow gorge into which its broad-breasted waters are driven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back from the bluff of West Point extends a natural platform of near half
a mile square, high, level, and beautifully amphitheatred with wood and rock.
This is the site of the Military Academy, and a splendid natural parade.
When the tents of the summer camp are shining on the field; the flag, with
its blood-bright stripes, waving against the foliage of the hills; the trumpet
echoing from bluff to bluff, and the compact battalion cutting its trim line
across the green-sward,—there are few more fairy spots in this working-day
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the extreme edge of the summit, overlooking the river, stands a marble
shaft, pointing like a bright finger to glory,—the tomb of the soldier and patriot
Kosciusko. The military colleges and other buildings skirt the parade on the
side of the mountain; and forward, toward the river, on the western edge,
stands a spacious hotel, from the verandahs of which the traveller gets a view
through the Highlands that he remembers till he dies. Right up before
him, with the smooth curve of an eagle’s ascent, rises the “old cro’ nest” of
the culprit Fay,—a bright green mountain, that thrusts its topmost pine into
the sky; the Donderbarrak, or (if it is not sacrilege to translate so fine a
name for a mountain), the Thunder-chamber, heaves its round shoulder beyond;
back from the opposite shore, as if it recoiled from these, leans the bold cliff
of Breknock; and then looking out, as if from a cavern, into the sun-light,
the eye drops beyond upon a sheet of wide-spreading water, with an emerald
island on its bosom; the white buildings of Newburg creeping back to the
plains beyond, and in the far, far distance the wavy and blue line of the
Catskills, as if it were the dim-seen edge of an outer horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passage through the Highlands at West Point still bears the old
name of Wey-gat, or Wind-gate; and one of the prettiest moving dioramas
conceivable is the working through the gorge of the myriad sailing-craft
of the river. The sloops which ply upon the Hudson, by the way, are
remarkable for their picturesque beauty, and for the enormous quantity of
sail they carry on in all weathers; and nothing is more beautiful than the
little fleets of from six to a dozen, all tacking or scudding together, like
so many white sea-birds on the wing. Up they come, with a dashing
breeze, under Anthony’s Nose and the Sugar-Loaf, and giving the rocky
toe of West Point a wide berth, all down helm, and round into the bay;
when—just as the peak of Crow Nest slides its shadow over the main-sail—slap
comes the wind aback, and the whole fleet is in a flutter. The
channel is narrow and serpentine, the wind baffling, and small room to
beat; but the little craft are worked merrily and well; and dodging about,
as if to escape some invisible imp in the air, they gain point after point,
till at last they get the Donderbarrak behind them, and fall once more into
the regular current of the wind.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='t673'>TOWN OF CATSKILL, HUDSON RIVER.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-longline.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0009' style='width:20%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>C</span>ATSKILL is more known as the landing-place for travellers bound to the
mountains above, than for any remarkable events in its own history, or
any singular beauties in itself. It is a thrifty town, in which the most prosperous
vocations are those of inn-keeper and stage-proprietor; and during the
summer months these two crafts at Catskill entertain and transport to the
hotel on the mountain half the population of the United States,—more or
less. The crowded steamers stop at the landing on their way up and down;
and a busier scene than is presented on the wharf daily could not easily be
found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have often thought, in passing, of the contrast between these numerous
advents and the landing of Hendrick Hudson on this very spot, in his voyage
of discovery up the river. He found here, he says, “a very loving people
and a very old man,” by whom he and his crew were very kindly entertained.
From the first step of a white man’s foot on the soil to the crowded rush of
passengers from a steam-boat; from a savage wilderness to the height of civilization
and science,—it is but a little more than two hundred years of rapid
history. Compare the old Indian canoe in which Hudson went from his vessel
to the land, with a steamer carrying on its deck near a thousand souls;
compare the untutored population which then swarmed upon the shore, with
the cultivated and refined crowds who come and go in thousands on the same
spot,—and the contrast is as astonishing as the extinction of the aboriginal
race is melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is surprising how few details connected with the races that inhabited
the older settlements of our country are reached even by the researches of
Historical Societies. The materials for the future poets and historians of
America are in this department singularly meagre, though it might almost
be supposed that the very tracks of the retreating tribes might at this early
day be still visible on the soil. Wherever any particulars of the intercourse
between the first settlers and the Indians are preserved, they are highly
curious, and often very diverting. In a book on the settlements of this country,
written by Captain Nathaniel Uring, who visited it in 1709, there is an
interesting story connected with the history of one of the forts, built, by permission
of the Indians, to secure the settlers against sudden incursion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It happened one day,” says the Captain, relating the story as it was told to
him by the Governor, “as the carpenter was cutting down a large timber-tree
for the use of the fort, that great numbers of Indians stood round it, gazing,
and admiring the wonderful dexterity of the carpenter, and greatly surprised at
the manner of cutting it,—having, before the arrival of the Europeans, never
seen an axe, or any such like tools. The carpenter, perceiving the tree ready
to fall, gave notice to the Indians by language or signs to keep out of its
reach when it fell; but either for want of understanding the carpenter, or by
carelessness of the Indians, a branch of the tree in its fall struck one of
them, and killed him; upon which they raised a great cry. The carpenter,
seeing them much out of humor at the accident, made his escape into the fort;
and soon after, the Indians gathered together in great numbers about it and
demanded justice of the Europeans for the death of their brother, and desired
to have the man who was the occasion of his being killed, that they might
execute him, and revenge their brother’s death. The Governor endeavored to
excuse the carpenter, by representing to them that he was not to blame; and
told them that if their brother had observed the notice given him by the carpenter,
he had not been hurt. But that answer would not satisfy the Indians;
they increased their numbers about the fort, and nothing less than the execution
of the carpenter would content them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Europeans endeavored to spin out the time by treaty, and thought
to appease them by presents, hoping those, and time together, might make
them easy; but finding that would not do, and not being able longer to defend
themselves against such numbers as besieged them, they consulted how to
give the Indians satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The carpenter being a useful man, they considered that they could not
spare him without the greatest inconvenience; but seeing there was an absolute
necessity of doing something, they found out an expedient, which was
this: There was in the fort an old weaver, who had been bed-rid a long
time; <span class='it'>they concluded to hang up the weaver, and make the Indians believe it
was the carpenter</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having come to this resolution, the Governor let the Indians know that
since nothing else would satisfy them, though their demand was unjust, yet to
show them how ready they were to live in amity and friendship with them,
in the morning they should see the carpenter hanging upon a certain tree
in their view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the night they carried the poor old weaver and hanged him in the
room of the carpenter, which gave full satisfaction to the Indians; and they
were again good friends.”</p>

and limpid pools for several miles, it suddenly bursts out over a precipice of
fifty feet, and fills with its clear waters the sheltered basin seen in the drawing.
Immense trees overhang it on every side, and follow the stream still
on in its course; and in the depth of summer the foaming current scarcely
catches a ray of the sun from its source to its outlet. The floor of the basin
below the Fall is pebbly, the water is clear and cool, the spot secluded, and
in all respects Nature has formed it for a bath. A fair and famous lady,
residing a summer or two since at West Point, was its first known Musidora;
and the limpid and bright basin is already called after her name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large party visiting at a hospitable house where the artist and his
travelling companion were entertained during the heat of the last summer,
proposed to accompany him on his visit to the Indian Fall. Excursions on
the banks of the Hudson are usually made in boats; but it was necessary to
see some points of view from the hills between, and we walked out to the
stables to see what could be done for vehicles and cattle. A farm wagon,
with its tail up in the air, built after an old Dutch fashion which still prevails
in New York,—a sort of loosely jointed, long, lumbering vehicle, which
was meant to go over any rock smaller than a beer-barrel without upsetting,—was
the only “consarn,” as the “help” called it, which would hold the party.
With straw in the bottom, and straps put across from peg to peg, it would
carry eleven, and the driver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horses were the next consideration; and here we were rather staggered.
A vicious old mare, that kept a wheelwright and a surgeon in constant
employ, and a powerful young colt half broken, were the only steeds
in stable. However either might be made to go alone, they had never
been tried together; and the double-wagon harness was the worse for service.
The “help” suggested very sensibly that the load would be too
heavy to run away with; and that if the mare kicked, or the colt bolted,
or in short if anything happened except backing over a precipice, we had
only to sit still and let them do their “darndest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cobbled the harness in its weak spots, shook down the straw for
the ladies, nailed up the tail-board, which had lost its rods, got the cattle
in, and brought up quietly to the door. The ladies and the champagne were
put in, and the colt was led off by the bit, shaking his head and catching
up his hind leg; while the demure old mare drew off tamely and
steadily, “never wicked,” as the ploughman said, “till you got her dander
up with a tough hill.” The driver had a chain with a list bottom, and
having had some practice in Charing Cross and Fleet Street fingered his
reins and flourished his maple whip through the village, evidently not
thinking himself or his driving <span class='it'>de la petite bière</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road, which followed the ridges of the superb hills skirting the
river opposite West Point, was in some places scarce fit even for a bridlepath;
and at every few paces came a rock, which we believed passable
when we had surged over it,—not before. The two ill-matched animals
drew to a wonder; and the ladies and the champagne had escaped all damage,
till, as the enemy of mankind would have it, our ambitious whip saw
stretching out before him a fair quarter of a mile of more even road. A
slight touch of the whip sent off the colt in a jump, carrying away the off
trace with the first spring; the old mare struck into a gallop, and with the
broken trace striking against the colt’s heels, and the whippletree parallel with
the pole, away they went as nearly in a tandem as the remaining part of the
harness would allow. The tail-board soon flew off, and let out two unsuspecting
gentlemen, who had placed their backs and their reliance upon it; and
the screams of the ladies added what was wanting to raise the “dander” of
the old mare to its most unpleasant climax. The straps gave way, the ladies
rolled together in the straw, the driver tossed about on his list-bottomed chain,
the champagne corks flew,—and presently, as if we were driven by a battering-ram
against a wall, we brought up with a tremendous crash, and stood
still. We had come to a sharp turn in the road; and the horses, unable to
turn, had leaped a low stone wall, and breaking clear of everything left us
on one side, while they thrashed the ripe wheat with the whippletrees on the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies were undamaged, fortunately; and, with one champagne bottle
saved from the wreck, we completed the excursion to the Fall on foot, and
were too happy to return by water.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HIS mountain, “known to fame,” serves as a landmark to the industrious
craft plying upon the Hudson, and thus fulfils a more useful
destiny than is commonly awarded to spots bright in story. It stands
amid a host of interesting localities marked by the events of the Revolution,
and has witnessed, with less damage than other noses, many a conflict
by land and water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the opposite side of the river from the base of the mountain lie
the two forts—Montgomery and Clinton—taken by the British in October,
1777. The commander-in-chief at New York was prompted to this expedition
by two objects,—to destroy a quantity of military stores which the
Americans had collected in this neighborhood, and to make a diversion in
favor of General Burgoyne. For these purposes Sir Henry Clinton
embarked between three and four thousand troops at New York, and sailed
with them up the Hudson. On the 5th of October they landed at Verplank’s
Point, a few miles below the entrance to the Highlands. The next
morning, a part of the force landed on Stony Point, which projects into the
river on the western side, just below the mountains; hence they marched to
the rear of the fortresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Putnam commanded at that time in this quarter. He had one
thousand continental troops, a part of which only were effective, and a small
body of militia. He believed the principal design of the enemy to be the
destruction of the stores; and when he was informed of their main purpose,
it was too late for him to resist with success. He supposed that they were
aiming at Fort Independence, and directed his attention to its defence: the
heavy firing on the other side of the river gave him the first decisive information
of their real intentions. George Clinton, at that time governor of the State,
placed himself at this post on the first notice that he received of the enemy’s
advancing. Having made the best disposition for the defence of the forts, he
dispatched an express to General Putnam to acquaint him with his situation;
but when it reached Putnam’s headquarters, that officer and General Parsons
were reconnoitring the position of the enemy on the east side of the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, in the mean time, proceeded with nine hundred
men by a circuitous march to the rear of Fort Montgomery; while Sir
Henry Clinton, with Generals Vaughan and Tryon, moved onwards towards
Fort Clinton. Both fortresses were attacked at once, between four and five in
the afternoon: they were defended with great resolution. This will be readily
admitted, when it is remembered that the whole garrison consisted of but six
hundred men. The conflict was carried on till dark, when the British had
obtained absolute possession, and such of the Americans as were not killed or
wounded had made their escape. The loss of the two garrisons amounted to
about two hundred and fifty. Among the killed on the enemy’s side was
Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been thought that an addition of five or six hundred men to
these garrisons would have saved the works; the correctness of this opinion
may be doubted. Fifteen hundred soldiers would have been barely sufficient
completely to man Fort Montgomery alone. The works themselves were
imperfect, and the ground was probably chosen rather for the defence of
the river than because it was itself defensible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Governor Clinton and his brother, General James Clinton, escaped after
the enemy had possession of the forts,—the former by crossing the river;
the latter had been wounded in the thigh by a bayonet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 8th, the English forces proceeded to the eastern side, where they
found Fort Independence evacuated. A party then burned the continental
village as it was called,—a temporary settlement raised up by the war for the
accommodation of the army. Here had been gathered a considerable number
of those artisans whose labors are particularly necessary for military purposes,
and a considerable quantity of military stores. They then removed a chain
which was stretched across the river at Fort Montgomery, and advancing up
the river removed another, which was extended from Fort Constitution to the
opposite shore at West Point. General Vaughan then advanced still farther
up the Hudson, and on the 13th reached the town of Kingston, which he
burned. On the 17th took place the surrender of Burgoyne, and General
Vaughan returned down the Hudson with his fleet to New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Count Grabouski, a Polish nobleman, was killed in the assault on Fort Clinton,
while acting as an aid-de-camp to the British commander. He was buried
on the spot, but his grave is now undiscoverable.</p>

of the Mohawk and Hudson, the Falls of the Cohoes, the gay and elegant
town of Troy, Albany in the distance, and a foreground of the finest mixture
of the elements of landscape, compose a gratification to the eye equalled by
few other spots in this country. “Think,” says one of our noblest and best
writers, speaking of a similar scene,—“think of the country for which the
Indians fought! Who can blame them? As the river chieftains, the lords of
the waterfalls and the mountains, ranged this lovely valley, can it be wondered
at that they beheld with bitterness the forest disappearing beneath the settler’s
axe, the fishing-place disturbed by his saw-mills? Can we not fancy the
feelings with which some strong-minded savage, who should have ascended
the summit of the mountain in company with a friendly settler, contemplating
the progress already made by the white man, and marking the gigantic strides
with which he was advancing into the wilderness, should fold his arms and
say: ‘White man, there is eternal war between me and thee! I quit not the
land of my fathers but with my life! In those woods where I bent my youthful
bow, I will still hunt the deer; over yonder waters I will still glide unrestrained
in my bark canoe; by those dashing waterfalls I will still lay up
my winter’s food; on these fertile meadows I will still plant my corn.
Stranger, the land is mine! I understand not these paper rights; I gave not
my consent when, as thou sayest, those broad regions were purchased for a
few baubles of my fathers. They could sell what was theirs; they could sell
no more. How could my father sell that which the Great Spirit sent me into
the world to live upon? They knew not what they did. The stranger came,
a timid suppliant, few and feeble, and asked to lie down on the red man’s
bear-skin, and warm himself at the red man’s fire, and have a little piece
of land to raise corn for his women and children; and now he is become
strong and mighty and bold, and spreads out his parchment over the whole,
and says, It is mine! Stranger, there is not room for us both. The Great
Spirit has not made us to live together. There is poison in the white man’s
cup; the white man’s dog barks at the red man’s heels. If I should leave
the land of my fathers, whither shall I fly? Shall I go to the south, and
dwell among the groves of the Pequots? Shall I wander to the west?—the
fierce Mohawk, the man-eater, is my foe. Shall I fly to the east?—the
great water is before me. No, stranger, here have I lived, and here will I die;
and if here thou abidest, there is eternal war between me and thee! Thou
hast taught me thy arts of destruction,—for that alone I thank thee. And
now take heed to thy steps; the red man is thy foe. When thou goest forth
by day, my bullet shall whistle by thee; when thou liest down at night, my
knife is at thy throat. The noonday sun shall not discover thy enemy, and
the darkness of midnight shall not protect thy rest. Thou shalt plant in
terror, and I will reap in blood; thou shalt sow the earth with corn, and I
will strew it with ashes; thou shalt go forth with the sickle, and I will follow
after with the scalping-knife; thou shalt build, and I will burn, till the white
man or the Indian shall cease from the land. Go thy way for this time in
safety; but remember, stranger, there is eternal war between thee and me!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the same writer afterward observes, however, the Pilgrim Fathers “purchased
the land of those who claimed it, and paid for it,—often, more than
once. They purchased it for a consideration trifling to the European, but
valuable to the Indian. There is no overreaching in giving but little for
that which in the hands of the original proprietors is worth nothing.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-longline.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0018' style='width:20%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HIS view out from the gorge of the Highlands presents a foreground of
cliff and shadow, with their reflections almost folded across in the bosom
of the river, and a middle ground of the village of Newburg and the gently-undulating
country in the rear. The blue and far-off line of the Catskills
shuts in the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is some very romantic scenery hidden among the undulations just
mentioned, embracing several small rivers, and also a romantic stream called
Murderer’s Creek,—a tributary of the Hudson. Mr. Paulding, in his “New
Mirror for Travellers,” gives the following interesting legend in explanation of
the name:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little more than a century ago, the beautiful region watered by this
stream was possessed by a small tribe of Indians, which has long since
become extinct, or been incorporated with some other savage nation of the
West. Three or four hundred yards from where the stream discharges itself
into the Hudson, a white family of the name of Stacey had established itself
in a log-house by tacit permission of the tribe, to whom Stacey had made
himself useful by his skill in a variety of little arts highly estimated by the
savages. In particular, a friendship existed between him and an old Indian
called Naoman, who often came to his house and partook of his hospitality.
The Indians never forgive injuries or forget benefits. The family consisted of
Stacey, his wife, and two children,—a boy and girl; the former five, the latter
three years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legend goes on to say that Naoman, in grateful friendship, gave the
wife of Stacey a secret warning that a massacre of the whites was resolved
on, exacting from her a solemn pledge of secrecy, and advising instant escape
across the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The daily visits of old Naoman and his more than ordinary gravity had
excited suspicion in some of the tribe, who had accordingly paid particular
attention to the movements of Stacey. One of the young Indians, who had
kept on the watch, seeing the whole family about to take their boat, ran to
the little Indian village, about a mile off, and gave the alarm. Five Indians
collected, ran down to the river side where their canoes were moored, jumped
in and paddled after Stacey, who by this time had got some distance out
into the stream. They gained on him so fast that twice he dropped his paddle
and took up his gun. But his wife prevented his shooting, by telling
him that if he fired, and they were afterwards overtaken, they would meet no
mercy from the Indians. He accordingly refrained, and plied his paddle till
the sweat rolled in big drops down his forehead. All would not do; they
were overtaken within a hundred yards of the shore, and carried back with
shouts of yelling triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When they got ashore, the Indians set fire to Stacey’s house, and
dragged himself, his wife, and children to their village. Here the principal
old men, and Naoman among the rest, assembled to deliberate on the affair.
The chief among them stated that some one of the tribe had undoubtedly
been guilty of treason in apprising Stacey the white man of the designs of
the tribe, whereby he took the alarm and had well nigh escaped. He proposed
to examine the prisoners as to who gave the information. The old
men assented to this, and Naoman among the rest. Stacey was first interrogated
by one of the old men who spoke English, and interpreted to the
others. Stacey refused to betray his informant. His wife was then questioned,
while at the same moment two Indians stood threatening the two
children with tomahawks in case she did not confess. She attempted to
evade the truth, by declaring she had a dream the night before which had
alarmed her, and that she had persuaded her husband to fly. ‘The Great
Spirit never deigns to talk in dreams to a white face,’ said the old Indian.
‘Woman! thou hast two tongues and two faces: speak the truth, or thy children
shall surely die.’ The little boy and girl were then brought close to
her, and the two savages stood over them, ready to execute their bloody
orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Wilt thou name,’ said the old Indian, ‘the red man who betrayed his
tribe? I will ask thee three times.’ The mother answered not. ‘Wilt thou
name the traitor? This is the second time.’ The poor mother looked at her
husband, and then at her children, and stole a glance at Naoman, who sat
smoking his pipe with invincible gravity. She wrung her hands and wept,
but remained silent. ‘Wilt thou name the traitor? ’Tis the third and last
time.’ The agony of the mother waxed more bitter; again she sought the
eye of Naoman, but it was cold and motionless. A pause of a moment
awaited her reply, and the next moment the tomahawks were raised over the
heads of the children, who besought their mother not to let them be murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Stop!’ cried Naoman. All eyes were turned upon him. ‘Stop!’ repeated
he in a tone of authority. ‘White woman, thou hast kept thy word
with me to the last moment. I am the traitor. I have eaten of the salt,
warmed myself at the fire, shared the kindness of these Christian white people;
and it was I that told them of their danger. I am a withered, leafless,
branchless trunk; cut me down if you will. I am ready.’ A yell of indignation
sounded on all sides. Naoman descended from the little bank where he
sat, shrouded his face with his mantle of skins, and submitted to his fate.
He fell dead at the feet of the white woman by a blow of the tomahawk.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>F</span>ROM this admirably chosen spot, the Bay of New York appears with
every accessory of beauty. The city itself comes into the left of the picture
to an advantage seen from no other point of view. The flocks of river-craft
scud past in all directions; men-of-war, merchantmen, steamers, and
ferry-boats fill up the moving elements of the panorama; and far away
beyond stretches the broad harbor, with its glassy or disturbed waters, in all
the varieties of ever-changing sea-view. It was on this side that Hudson,
who had felt the hostility of the Manhattan Indians, found a friendlier tribe,
and made his first amicable visit on shore. The Indian tradition springing
from that visit, and describing the first intoxication they had ever experienced,
is extremely amusing.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“A long time ago, before men with a white skin had ever been seen,
some Indians, fishing at a place where the sea widens, espied something at a
distance moving upon the water. They hurried ashore, collected their neighbors,
who together returned and viewed intensely this astonishing phenomenon.
What it could be, baffled all conjecture. Some supposed it to be a
large fish or animal; others that it was a very big house floating on the sea.
Perceiving it moving towards land, the spectators concluded that it would be
proper to send runners in different directions to carry the news to their
scattered chiefs, that they might send off for the immediate attendance of
their warriors. These arriving in numbers to behold the sight, and perceiving
that it was actually moving towards them (that is, coming into the river or
bay), they conjectured that it must be a remarkably large house, in which the
Manitto (or Great Spirit) was coming to visit them. They were much afraid,
and yet under no apprehension that the Great Spirit would injure them.
They worshipped him. The chiefs now assembled at York Island, and consulted
in what manner they should receive their Manitto. Meat was prepared
for a sacrifice; the women were directed to prepare the best of victuals; idols
or images were examined and put in order; a grand dance they thought
would be pleasing, and, in addition to the sacrifice, might appease him, if
angry. The conjurers were also set to work to determine what this phenomenon
portended, and what the result would be. To these, men, women, and
children looked up for advice and protection. Utterly at a loss what to do,
and distracted alternately by hope and fear, in this confusion a grand dance
commenced. Meantime fresh runners arrived, declaring it to be a great
house of various colors, and full of living creatures. It now appeared certain
that it was their Manitto, probably bringing some new kind of game. Others
arriving, declared it positively to be full of people of different color and dress
from theirs, and that one in particular appeared altogether <span class='it'>red</span>. This then
must be the Manitto. They were lost in admiration; could not imagine what
the vessel was, whence it came, or what all this portended. They are now
hailed from the vessel in a language they cannot understand; they answer
by a shout or yell in their way. The house (or large canoe, as some render
it) stops. A smaller canoe comes on shore, with the red man in it; some
stay by his canoe to guard it. The chiefs and wise men form a circle, into
which the red man and two attendants enter. He salutes them with friendly
countenance, and they return the salute after their manner. They are amazed
at the color and dress of the strangers, particularly with him who glittering in
red wore something (perhaps lace or buttons) they could not comprehend. He
<span class='it'>must</span> be the great Manitto, they thought; but why should he have a <span class='it'>white
skin</span>? A large elegant <span class='it'>hockhack</span> (<span class='it'>gourd</span>; that is, bottle, decanter, etc.) is brought
by one of the supposed Manitto’s servants, from which a substance is poured
into a small cup or glass and handed to the Manitto. He drinks, has the
glass refilled, and handed to the chief near him; he takes it, smells it, and
passes it to the next, who does the same. The glass in this manner is
passed round the circle, and is about to be returned to the red-clothed man
when one of them, a great warrior, harangues them on the impropriety of
returning the cup unemptied. It was handed to them, he said, by the
Manitto, to drink out of as he had. To follow his example would please him;
to reject it might provoke his wrath; and if no one else would, he would
drink it himself, let what would follow,—for it was better for one even to die
than a whole nation to be destroyed. He then took the glass, smelled at it,
again addressed them, bidding adieu, and drank the contents. All eyes were
now fixed on the first Indian in New York who had tasted the poison which
has since affected so signal a revolution in the condition of the native
Americans. He soon began to stagger; the women cried, supposing him in
fits; he rolled on the ground; they bemoan his fate; they thought him dying.
He fell asleep; they at first thought he had expired, but soon perceived he
still breathed. He awoke, jumped up, and declared he never felt more happy.
He asked for more; and the whole assembly, imitating him, became
intoxicated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In descending the river, after he had penetrated to Albany, Hudson ran
his little craft ashore at Weehawken; but the ground was a soft ooze, and
she was got off without damage, and proceeded to sea.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='t1704'>CHAPEL OF “OUR LADY OF COLD SPRING.”</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:.8em;'>Coldspring, Putnam Cy. N.Y.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-longline.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0022' style='width:20%;height:auto;'/>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE Hudson bends out from Crow-Nest into a small bay; and in the
lap of the crescent thus formed lies snug and sheltered the town of
Cold Spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a pity, picturesquely speaking, that the boatmen on the river are not
Catholics; it would be so pretty to see them shorten sail off Our Lady of
Cold Spring, and uncover for an Ave-Maria. This little chapel, so exquisitely
situated on the bluff overlooking the river, reminds me of a hermit’s oratory
and cross which is perched similarly in the shelter of a cliff on the desolate
coast of Sparta. I was on board a frigate, gliding slowly up the Ægean, and
clinging to the shore for a land-wind, when I descried the white cross at a distance
of about half a mile, strongly relieved against the dark rock in its rear.
As we approached, the small crypt and altar became visible; and at the
moment the ship passed, a tall monk, with a snow-white beard, stepped forth
like an apparition upon the cliffs, and spread out his arms to bless us. In the
midst of the intense solitude of the Ægean, with not a human dwelling to be
seen on the whole coast from Morea to Napoli, the effect of this silent benediction
was almost supernatural. He remained for five minutes in this attitude,
his long cowl motionless in the still air, and his head slowly turning to
the ship as she drew fast round the little promontory on her course. I would
suggest to Our Lady of Cold Spring, that a niche under the portico of her
pretty chapel, with a cross to be seen from the river by day and a lamp by
night, would make at least a catholic impression on the passer-by, though we
are not all children of St. Peter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half way between the mountain and Our Lady’s shrine stands, on a superb
natural platform, the romantic estate of Undercliff. Just above it rises the
abrupt and heavily-wooded mountain, from which it derives its name; a thick
grove hides it from the village at its foot, and from the portico of the mansion
extend views in three directions unparalleled for varied and surprising
beauty. A road running between high-water mark and the park gate skirts
the river in eccentric windings for five or six miles; the brows of the hills
descending to the Hudson in the west and north are nobly wooded and threaded
with circuitous paths; and all around lies the most romantic scenery of the
most romantic river in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only fault of the views from West Point is that West Point itself is
lost as a feature in the landscape. The traveller feels the same drawback
which troubled the waiting-maid when taken to drive by the footman in her
mistress’s chariot,—“How I wish I could stand by the road-side and see myself
go by!” From Undercliff, which is directly opposite, and about at the same
elevation, the superb terrace of the Military School is seen to the greatest
advantage. The white barracks of Camptown, the long range of edifices which
skirt the esplanade, the ruins of old Fort Putnam half way up the mountain,
and the waving line of wood and valley extending to the estate of “Stoney
Lonesome” form a noble feature in the view from Undercliff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had forgotten that Cold Spring “plucks a glory on its head” from being
honored with the frequent visits of Washington Irving, Halleck, and other
lesser stars in the literary firmament. Now that these first lights above the
horizon have set (Hesperus-like, first and brightest!), there lingers about the
town many a tale of the days when Geoffrey Crayon talked in his gentle
way with the ferryman who brought him to Cold Spring; or the now plethoric
post-master, who in his character of librarian to the village enjoyed the friendship
of Irving and Halleck, and received from their own hands the “author’s
copies,” since curiously preserved in the execrable print and binding then
prevalent in America. Perhaps even old Lipsey the ferryman, and his rival
Andrews, will come in for their slice of immortality, little as they dream now,
pulling close in for the counter-current under Our Lady’s skirts, of working at
that slow oar for posthumous reputation.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='t1913'>PEEKSKILL LANDING, HUDSON RIVER.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-longline.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0025' style='width:20%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>L</span>IKE most of the <span class='it'>landings</span> on the Hudson, Peekskill is a sort of outstretched
hand from the interior of the country. It is about eighty miles from
New York, and the produce from the country behind is here handed over to the
trading sloops, who return into the waiting palm the equivalent in goods from
the city. A sort of town naturally springs up at such a spot, and as a river-side
is a great provocative of idleness, all the Dolph Heyligers of the country
about seem to be collected at the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighborhood of this spot is interesting from its association with the
history of the Revolution. The headquarters of General Washington were just
below, at Verplank’s Point; and the town of Peekskill, half a mile back from
the river, was the depot of military stores, which were burned by General Howe
in 1777.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On my return southward in 1782,” says the translator of Chastellux, who
has not given his name, “I spent a day or two at the American camp at
Verplank’s Point, where I had the honor of dining with General Washington.
I had suffered severely from an ague, which I could not get quit of, though I
had taken the exercise of a hard-trotting horse, and got thus far to the north
in the month of October. The General observing it, told me he was sure I
had not met with a good glass of wine for some time,—an article then very
rare,—but that my disorder must be frightened away. He made me drink
three or four of his silver camp-cups of excellent Madeira at noon, and recommended
to me to take a generous glass of claret after dinner,—a prescription
by no means repugnant to my feelings, and which I most religiously followed.
I mounted my horse the next morning, and continued my journey to Massachusetts,
without ever experiencing the slightest return of my disorder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The American camp here presented the most beautiful and picturesque
appearance. It extended along the plain, on the neck of land formed by the
winding of the Hudson, and had a view of this river to the south. Behind it,
the lofty mountains, covered with wood, formed the most sublime background
that painting could express. In the front of the tents was a regular continued
portico, formed by the boughs of the trees in full verdure, decorated with much
taste and fancy. Opposite the camp, and on distinct eminences, stood the tents
of some of the general officers, over which towered predominant that of Washington.
I had seen all the camps in England, from many of which drawings and
engravings have been taken; but this was truly a subject worthy the pencil of
the first artist. The French camp, during their stay in Baltimore, was decorated
in the same manner. At the camp at Verplank’s Point we distinctly heard the
morning and evening gun of the British at Knightsbridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curiosity seizes with avidity upon any accidental information which
fills up the bare outline of history. The personal history of Washington more
particularly, wherever it has been traced by those who were in contact with
him, is full of interest. Some of the sketches given by the Marquis of Chastellux,
who passed this point of the Hudson on his way to Washington’s headquarters
below, are very graphic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The weather being fair on the 26th,” he says, “I got on horseback, after
breakfasting with the General. He was so attentive as to give me the horse
I rode on the day of my arrival. I found him as good as he is handsome;
but, above all, perfectly well broke and well trained, having a good mouth, easy
in hand, and stopping short in a gallop without bearing the bit. I mention
these minute particulars because it is the General himself who breaks all his
own horses. He is an excellent and bold horseman, leaping the highest fences,
and going extremely quick without standing upon his stirrups, bearing on the
bridle, or letting his horse run wild,—circumstances which our young men look
upon as so essential a part of English horsemanship, that they would rather
break a leg or an arm than renounce them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After passing some days at headquarters, this young nobleman thus admirably
sums up his observations on Washington:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The strongest characteristic of this great man is the perfect union which
reigns between his physical and moral qualities. Brave without temerity, laborious
without ambition, generous without prodigality, noble without pride, virtuous
without severity,—he seems always to have confined himself within those
limits beyond which the virtues, by clothing themselves in more lively but more
changeable colors, may be mistaken for faults. It will be said of him hereafter,
that <span class='it'>at the end of a long civil war he had nothing with which he could reproach
himself</span>. His stature is noble and lofty; he is well made and exactly
proportioned; his physiognomy mild and agreeable, but such as to render it
impossible to speak particularly of any of his features,—so that on quitting
him, you have only the recollection of a fine face. He has neither a grave nor
a familiar air; his brow is sometimes marked with thought, but never with
inquietude; in inspiring respect he inspires confidence, and his smile is always
the smile of benevolence.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='t2059'>VIEW FROM RUGGLE’S HOUSE, NEWBURGH, HUDSON RIVER.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-longline.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0027' style='width:20%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>N</span>EWBURG stands upon a pretty acclivity, rising with a sharp ascent
from the west bank of the Hudson; and in point of trade and consequence,
it is one of the first towns on the river. In point of scenery Newburg
is as felicitously placed, perhaps, as any other spot in the world, having in its
immediate neighborhood every element of natural loveliness,—and just below,
the sublime and promising Pass of the Highlands. From the summit of the
acclivity, the view over Matteawan and Fishkill is full of beauty,—the deep
flow of the Hudson lying between, and the pretty villages just named sparkling
with their white buildings and cheerful steeples beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Newburg has a considerable trade with the back country, and steamboats
are running constantly between its pier and New York. If there were wanting
an index of the wondrous advance of enterprise and invention in our country,
we need not seek further than this simple fact,—a small intermediate town, on
one river, supporting such an amount of expensive navigation. About seventy
years ago Fulton made his first experiment in steam on the Hudson, amid the
unbelief and derision of the whole country. Let any one stand for one hour
on the pier at Newburg, and see those superb and swift palaces of motion
shoot past, one after the other, like gay and chasing meteors, and then read
poor Fulton’s account of his first experiment,—and never again throw discouragement
on the kindling fire of genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was building my first steam-boat,” said he to Judge Story, “the
project was viewed by the public at New York either with indifference or contempt,
as a visionary scheme. My friends, indeed, were civil, but they were
shy. They listened with patience to my explanations, but with a settled cast
of incredulity on their countenances. I felt the full force of the lamentation
of the poet,—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';fs:.9em;' -->
<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>“‘Truths would you teach, to save a sinking land?—</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>All shun, none aid you, and few understand.’</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“As I had occasion to pass daily to and from the building-yard while my
boat was in progress, I have often loitered, unknown, near the idle groups of
strangers gathering in little circles, and heard various inquiries as to the object
of this new vehicle. The language was uniformly that of scorn, sneer, or
ridicule. The loud laugh rose at my expense, the dry jest, the wise calculation
of losses and expenditure, the dull but endless repetition of ‘<span class='it'>the Fulton folly</span>.’
Never did a single encouraging remark, a bright hope, or a warm wish, cross
my path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At length the day arrived when the experiment was to be made. To me
it was a most trying and interesting occasion. I wanted many friends to go
on board to witness the first successful trip. Many of them did me the favor
to attend, as a matter of personal respect; but it was manifest they did it with
reluctance, fearing to be partners of my mortification and not of my triumph.
I was well aware that in my case there were many reasons to doubt of my own
success. The machinery was new and ill-made, and many parts of it were
constructed by mechanics unacquainted with such work; and unexpected difficulties
might reasonably be presumed to present themselves from other causes.
The moment arrived in which the word was to be given for the vessel to move.
My friends were in groups on the deck. There was anxiety mixed with fear
among them; they were silent, sad, and weary; I read in their looks nothing
but disaster, and almost repented of my efforts. The signal was given, and the
boat moved on a short distance, and then stopped and became immovable. To
the silence of the preceding moment now succeeded murmurs of discontent
and agitation, and whispers and shrugs. I could hear distinctly repeated, ‘I
told you so! It is a foolish scheme; I wish we were well out of it.’ I elevated
myself on a platform, and stated that I knew not what was the matter;
but if they would be quiet, and indulge me for half an hour, I would either go
on or abandon the voyage. I went below, and discovered that a slight maladjustment
was the cause. It was obviated. The boat went on. We left New
York; we passed through the Highlands; we reached Albany! Yet even
then imagination superseded the force of fact. <span class='it'>It was doubted if it could be
done again, or if it could be made, in any case, of any great value!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What an affecting picture of the struggles of a great mind, and what a vivid
lesson of encouragement to genius, is contained in this simple narrative!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>T this elevation you may wear woollen, and sleep under blankets in
midsummer; and that is a pleasant temperature where much hard work
is to be done in the way of pleasure-hunting. No place is so agreeable as Catskill
after one has been parboiled in the city. New York is at the other end of
that long thread of a river, running away south from the base of the mountain;
and you may change your climate in so brief a transit, that the most enslaved
broker in Wall Street may have half his home on Catskill. The cool woods,
the small silver lakes, the falls, the mountain-tops, are all delicious haunts for
the idler-away of the hot months; and to the credit of our taste, it may be said
they are fully improved. Catskill is a “resort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Catskill the busy and all-glorious Hudson is seen winding half its
silver length,—towns, villas, and white spires sparkling on the shores, and
snowy sails and gaily-painted steamers specking its bosom. It is a constant
diorama of the most lively beauty; and the traveller as he looks down upon
it sighs to make it a home. Yet a smaller and less-frequented stream would
best fulfil desires born of a sigh. There is either no seclusion on the Hudson,
or there is so much that the conveniences of life are difficult to obtain. Where
the steamers come to shore,—twenty a day, with each from one to seven hundred
passengers,—it is certainly far from secluded enough; yet away from
the landing-places servants find your house too lonely, and your table, without
unreasonable expense and trouble, is precarious and poor. These mean and
<span class='it'>menus plaisirs</span> reach, after all, the very citadel of philosophy. Who can live
without a cook or a chamber-maid, and dine seven days in the week on veal,
consoling himself with the beauties of a river-side?</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the smaller rivers these evils are somewhat ameliorated; for in the
rural and uncorrupt villages of the interior you may find servants born on the
spot, and content to live in the neighborhood. The market is better, too, and
the society less exposed to the evils that result from too easy an access to the
metropolis. No place can be rural, in all the <span class='it'>virtues</span> of the phrase, where a
steamer will take the villager to the city between noon and night, and bring
him back between midnight and morning. There is a suburban look and
character about all the villages on the Hudson which seem out of place among
such scenery. They are suburbs; in fact, steam has destroyed the distance
between them and the city.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>S</span>ING-SING is famous for its marble, of which there is an extensive quarry
near by; for its State-prison, of which the discipline is of the most salutary
character; and for its academy, which has a high reputation. It may be
said, altogether, to do the State some service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The county of West Chester, of which this is the principal town on the
Hudson, has been made the scene of perhaps the best historical novel of our
country, and more than any other part of the United States suffered from the
evils of war during the Revolution. The character and depredations of the
“cow-boys” and “skinners,” whose fields of action were on the skirts of this
neutral ground, are familiar to all who have read “the Essay” of Mr. Cooper.
A distinguished clergyman gives the following very graphic picture of West
Chester County in Revolutionary days:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the autumn of 1777 I resided for some time in this county. The
lines of the British were then in the neighborhood of Kingsbridge, and those
of the Americans at Byram River. The unhappy inhabitants were therefore
exposed to the depredations of both. Often they were actually plundered, and
always were liable to this calamity. They feared everybody whom they saw,
and loved nobody. It was a curious fact to a philosopher, and a melancholy
one, to hear their conversation. To every question they gave such an answer
as would please the inquirer; or if they despaired of pleasing, such a one as
would not provoke him. Fear was apparently the only passion by which they
were animated. The power of volition seemed to have deserted them. They
were not civil, but obsequious; not obliging, but subservient. They yielded
with a kind of apathy, and very quietly, what you asked, and what they supposed
it impossible for them to retain. If you treated them kindly they
received it coldly; not as a kindness, but as a compensation for injuries done
them by others. When you spoke to them, they answered you without either
good or ill nature, and without any appearance of reluctance or hesitation; but
they subjoined neither questions nor remarks of their own,—proving to your
full conviction that they felt no interest either in the conversation or yourself.
Both their countenances and their motions had lost every trace of animation
and of feeling. Their features were smoothed, not into serenity, but apathy;
and instead of being settled in the attitude of quiet thinking, strongly indicated
that all thought beyond what was merely instinctive had fled their
minds forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their houses, meantime, were in a great measure scenes of desolation.
Their furniture was extensively plundered or broken to pieces. The walls,
floors, and windows were injured both by violence and decay, and were not
repaired because they had not the means to repair them, and because they
were exposed to the repetition of the same injuries. Their cattle were gone;
their enclosures were burned where they were capable of becoming fuel, and
in many cases thrown down where they were not. Their fields were covered
with a rank growth of weeds and wild grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amid all this appearance of desolation, nothing struck my eye more
forcibly than the sight of the high road. Where I had heretofore seen a continual
succession of horses and carriages, life and bustle lending a sprightliness
to all the environing objects, not a single solitary traveller was seen, from week
to week or from month to month. The world was motionless and silent,
except when one of these unhappy people ventured upon a rare and lonely
excursion to the house of a neighbor no less unhappy, or a scouting party,
traversing the country in quest of enemies, alarmed the inhabitants with expectations
of new injuries and sufferings. The very tracks of the carriages
were grown over and obliterated; and where they were discernible resembled
the faint impressions of chariot wheels, said to be left on the pavements of
Herculaneum. The grass was of full height for the scythe, and strongly realized
to my own mind, for the first time, the proper import of that picturesque
declaration in the Song of Deborah: ‘In the days of Shamgar, the son of
Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers
walked through by-paths. The inhabitants of the villages ceased: they ceased
in Israel.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>West Chester is a rough county in natural surface; but since the days
when the above description was true, its vicinity to New York, and the ready
market for produce have changed its character to a thriving agricultural district.
It is better watered with springs, brooks, and mill-streams, than many
other parts of New York, and among other advantages enjoys along the
Hudson a succession of brilliant and noble scenery.</p>

now in ruins, but is visited by all travellers in this region for the superb view
which it affords of the sublime pass of the Highlands. This was the great
key which Arnold’s treachery intended to give into the hands of the English;
and associated with the memory of the unfortunate André, and with other
painful events of the conspiracy, it possesses an interest which is wanting to
other objects of the same description in our country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Washington’s visit of inspection to Fort Putnam and the other redoubts
on this side the river was made only two or three hours before his discovery
of the treason of Arnold, at that moment, as he supposed, in command at West
Point. The commander-in-chief was expected to arrive the evening before;
and had he done so, Arnold would probably never have escaped. Having accidentally
met the French minister, M. de Lucerne, at Fishkill, however (eight
miles above), he was induced to pass the night there for the purpose of some
conference, and set off early in the morning on horseback, sending on a messenger
to Mrs. Arnold that himself and suite would be with her to breakfast.
Arriving opposite West Point, near a small redoubt called Fort Constitution,
Washington turned his horse from the road. Lafayette, who was then in his
suite, called out, “General, you are going in the wrong direction; you know
Mrs. Arnold is waiting breakfast for us.” “Ah,” answered Washington, “I
know you young men are all in love with Mrs. Arnold, and wish to get where
she is as soon as possible. Go and take your breakfast with her, and tell her
not to wait for me; I must ride down and examine the redoubts on this side
the river.” Two of the aides rode on, found breakfast waiting, and sat down
at once with General Arnold and his family. While they were at table a messenger
came in with a letter for Arnold, which announced the capture of André,
and the failure and betrayal, of course, of the whole conspiracy. Showing little
or no emotion, though his life hung upon a thread, he merely said to one of
his aides that his presence was required at West Point; and leaving word for
General Washington that he was called over the river, but would return immediately,
he ordered a horse and sent for Mrs. Arnold to her chamber. He
then informed her abruptly that they must part, possibly forever, and that
his life depended on his reaching the enemy’s lines without delay. Struck
with horror at this intelligence, she swooned and fell senseless. In that state
he left her, hurried downstairs, mounted a horse belonging to one of his aides
that stood saddled at the door, and rode with all speed to the bank of the
river. A boat with six men was in waiting; and pretending that he was
going with a flag of truce, he pulled down the stream, and arrived safe on
board the “Vulture” sloop of war, lying some miles below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime Washington, having finished his inspection of the redoubt, arrived
at Arnold’s house, received his message, and concluded to cross immediately
and meet Arnold at West Point. As the whole party were seated in the barge
moving smoothly over the water, with the majestic scenery of the Highlands
about them, Washington said, “Well, gentlemen, I am glad, on the whole,
that General Arnold has gone before us, for we shall now have a salute; and
the roaring of the cannon will have a fine effect among these mountains.”
The boat drew near to the beach, but no cannon were heard, and there was
no appearance of preparation to receive them. “What!” said Washington, “do
they not intend to salute us?” At this moment an officer was seen making
his way down the hill to meet them, who seemed confused at their arrival,
and apologized for not being prepared to receive such distinguished visitors.
“How is this, sir,” said Washington, “is not General Arnold here?” “No, sir,”
replied the officer, “he has not been here these two days; nor have I heard
from him within that time.” “This is extraordinary,” said Washington; “we
were told that he had crossed the river, and that we should find him here.
However, our visit must not be in vain. Since we have come, we must look
round a little, and see in what state things are with you.” He then ascended
the hill, examined Fort Putnam and the other fortifications, and returned
to Arnold’s house, where the fact of the treason was at once revealed.
This had occupied two or three hours, however, and Arnold was beyond pursuit.
Washington retained his usual calmness, though Arnold was one of his
favorite officers, and had been placed at West Point by his own personal
influence with Congress. He called Lafayette and Knox, showed them the
proofs, and only said to the former, “Whom can we trust now?”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>T is true of the Hudson, as of all other rivers, that to be seen to advantage
it should form the middle, not the foreground, of the picture. Those
who go to Albany by steam have something the same idea of the scenery of
West Point that an inside passenger may have of the effect of a stage-coach
at top-speed. It is astonishing how much foreground goes for in landscape;
and there are few passes of scenery where it is more naturally beautiful than
those of the Hudson. In the accompanying drawing, the picturesque neighborhood
of Undercliff, the seat of General Morris, lies between the river and
the artist, and directly opposite stands the peak of Crow Nest, mentioned in
the description of West Point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crow Nest is one of the most beautiful mountains of America for shape,
verdure, and position; and when the water is unruffled, and the moon sits on
his summit, he looks like a monarch crowned with a single pearl. This is
the scene of the first piece-work of fancy which has come from the practical
brain of America,—the poem of “The Culprit Fay.” The opening is so descriptive
of the spot that it is quite in place here; and to those who have
not seen the poem (as most European readers have not) it will convey an
idea of a production which, in my opinion, treads close on the heels of the
“Midsummer Night’s Dream:”—</p>

to the trial of the culprit fay, who has extinguished his elfin lamp and paralyzed
his wings by a love for a mortal maid. He is condemned to penances,
which are most exquisitely described, and constitute the greater part of the
poem; and he finally expiates his sins, and is forgiven. There is a fineness
of description, and a knowledge of the peculiarities of American nature, in
birds, fishes, flowers, and the phenomena of this particular region, which constitute
this little poem a book of valuable information as well as an exquisite
work of fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just under Crow Nest, buried in the heavy leaves of a ravine, springs a
waterfall like a naiad from the depths of the forest, and plunges down into
the river. The rambles in and about its neighborhood are cool and retired;
and it is a favorite place for lovers from New York, who run up in the
steamer in three hours, and find the honeymoon goes swimmingly off there,—the
excellent hotel within half a mile supplying the <span class='it'>real</span>, without which the

killed by the bursting of a gun, forms a picturesque object, and gives a story
to the spot.</p>

is steep and slippery to the very brink of the torrent, which it is
necessary to cross on the wild blocks that lie scattered in its rocky bed.
From thence, literally buried in forest foliage, the tourist will enjoy a very
different, but perhaps more striking and picturesque, view than the other.
The stream, at a vast height above him, is seen leaping from ledge to ledge,—sometimes
lost, sometimes sparkling in sunshine, till it courses impetuously
beneath the rock on which he is seated, and is lost in the deep unbroken
obscurity of the forest. The rocky ledges above, worn by time, have the appearance
of deep caverns, and beautifully relieve the fall of the light and
silvery stream. In the winter, the vast icicles which are suspended from the
ledges of rock, and shine like pillars against the deep obscurity of the caverns
behind, afford a most romantic spectacle, one which has afforded a subject
to Bryant for one of the most imaginative of his poems.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE pen of the poet and the pencil of the artist have so frequently united
to record the grandeur and sublimity of the Hudson, and with such
graphic fidelity, that little of interest remains unsaid or unsketched. But when
every point of its bold and beautiful scenery might be made the subject of a
picture, and every incident of its past history the theme of a poem, it requires
no great research to discover new and prominent objects of attraction. Perhaps
there is no portion of this beautiful river which partakes more of the
picturesque, or combines more of the wild and wonderful, than the vicinity of
the present view; and when time shall touch the history of the present with
the wand of tradition, and past events shall live in the memory of the future
as legends, romance will never revel in a more bewitching region. Fiction
shall then fling its imaginative veil over the things we have seen, covering
but not concealing them, and in the plentitude of poetic genius people the
drama of futurity with a thousand exquisite creations, clothed in the venerated
garb of antiquity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undercliff, the mansion of the late General George P. Morris, which
forms the principal object in the engraving, is situated upon an elevated plateau,
rising from the eastern shore of the river; and the selection of such a
commanding and beautiful position at once decides the taste of its intellectual
proprietor. In the rear of the villa, cultivation has placed her fruit and forest
trees with a profuse hand, and fertilized the fields with a variety of vegetable
products. The extent of the grounds is abruptly terminated by the base
of a rocky mountain, that rises nearly perpendicular to its summit, and affords
in winter a secure shelter from the bleak blasts of the north. In front, a circle
of greensward is refreshed by a fountain in the centre, gushing from a
Grecian vase, and encircled by ornamental shrubbery; from thence a gravelled
walk winds down a gentle declivity to a second plateau, and again descends
to the entrance of the carriage road, which leads upwards along the left slope
of the hill through a noble forest, the growth of many years, until suddenly
emerging from its sombre shades, the visitor beholds the mansion before him
in the bright blaze of day. A few openings in the wood afford an opportunity
to catch a glimpse of the water, sparkling with reflected light; and the
immediate transition from shadow to sunshine is peculiarly pleasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the sunny prospects from the villa—of the giant mountains in
their eternal verdure, the noble stream when frequent gusts ruffle its surface
into a thousand waves, the cluster of white cottages collected into the distant
village—are glorious, it is only by the lovely light of the moon, when
Nature is in repose, that their magic influence is fully felt. We were fortunate
in having an opportunity to contemplate the scene at such an hour. The
moon had risen from a mass of clouds which formed a line across the sky so
level that fancy saw her ascending from the dark sea, and her silvery light
lay softened on the landscape; silence was over all, save where the dipping
of a distant oar was echoed from the deep shadows of the rocks. Sometimes
the white sail of a sloop would steal into sight from the deep gloom, like
some shrouded spirit gliding from the confines of a giant’s cavern, recalling
the expressive lines by Moore:—</p>

<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>“The stream is like a silvery lake,</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>&ensp;&ensp;And o’er its face each vessel glides</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>Gently, as if it feared to wake</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>&ensp;&ensp;The slumber of the silent tides.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>General Morris published some time ago a volume of lyrical effusions,
called “The Deserted Bride, and other Poems.” Many of them have been
written among the fairy beauties of Undercliff, and under the inspiration of
that true poetic feeling which such enchanting scenes are so likely to elicit.
Where so many gems of genius enrich a work, it becomes difficult to decide
upon that most worthy of selection. It is not our province or intention to
review the volume, but we cannot resist the inclination to make an extract,
because it seems so beautiful an accessory to the subject, and must create an
added interest in the engraving. Where scenes are so replete with the poetry
of Nature, they are best illustrated by the poetry of numbers; but we were
particularly delighted with the following lines, addressed to his young daughter.
The natural simplicity of the subject is well expressed by the purity of
its poetic images, and breathes the refinement of paternal affection.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='t3582'>WINTER SCENE ON THE CATTERSKILLS.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE great proportion of evergreen trees, shrubs, and creepers in the
American mountains makes the winter scenery less dreary than might
at first be imagined; but even the nakedness of the deciduous trees is not
long observable. The first snow clothes them in a dress so feathery and
graceful that, like a change in the costume of beauty, it seems lovelier than
the one put off; and the constant renewal of its freshness and delicacy goes
on with a variety and novelty which is scarce dreamed of by those who see
snow only in cities, or in countries where it is rare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roads in so mountainous a region as the Catterskills are in winter
not only difficult, but dangerous. The following extracts from an account of
a sleigh-ride in a more level part of the country will serve to give an idea
of it:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As we got farther on, the new snow became deeper. The occasional farm-houses
were almost wholly buried, the black chimney alone appearing above
the ridgy drifts; while the tops of the doors and windows lay below the level
of the trodden road, from which a descending passage was cut to the threshold,
like the entrance to a cave in the earth. The fences were quite invisible.
The fruit-trees looked diminished to shrubberies of snow-flowers, their trunks
buried under the visible surface, and their branches loaded with the still falling
flakes, till they bent beneath the burden. Nothing was abroad, for nothing
could stir out of the road without danger of being lost; and we dreaded
to meet even a single sleigh, lest in turning out the horses should ‘slump’
beyond their depth in the untrodden drifts. The poor animals began to labor
severely, and sank at every step over their knees in the clogging and wool-like
substance; and the long and cumbrous sleigh rose and fell in the deep
pits like a boat in a heavy sea. It seemed impossible to get on. Twice we
brought up with a terrible plunge, and stood suddenly still; for the runners
had struck in too deep for the strength of the horses, and with the snow-shovels,
which formed a part of the furniture of the vehicle, we dug them
from their concrete beds. Our progress at last was reduced to scarce a mile
in the hour, and we began to have apprehensions that our team would give
out between the post-houses. Fortunately it was still warm, for the numbness
of cold would have paralyzed our already flagging exertions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had reached the summit of a long hill with the greatest difficulty.
The poor beasts stood panting and reeking with sweat; the runners of the
sleigh were clogged with hard cakes of snow, and the air was close and dispiriting.
We came to a stand-still, with the vehicle lying over almost on its
side; and I stepped out to speak to the driver and look forward. It was a
discouraging prospect; a long deep valley lay before us, closed at the distance
of a couple of miles by another steep hill, through a cleft in the top of
which lay our way: we could not even distinguish the line of the road between.
Our disheartened animals stood at this moment buried to their breasts;
and to get forward, without rearing at every step, seemed impossible. The
driver sat on his box, looking uneasily down into the valley. It was one undulating
ocean of snow,—not a sign of a human habitation to be seen, and
even the trees indistinguishable from the general mass by their whitened and
overladen branches. The storm had ceased, but the usual sharp cold that
succeeds a warm fall of snow had not yet lightened the clamminess of the
new-fallen flakes, and they clung around the foot like clay, rendering every
step a toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We heaved out of the pit into which the sleigh had settled, and for the
first mile it was down hill, and we got on with comparative ease. The sky
was by this time almost bare, a dark slaty mass of clouds alone settling on
the horizon in the quarter of the wind; while the sun, as powerless as moonlight,
poured with dazzling splendor on the snow, and the gusts came keen
and bitter across the sparkling waste, rimming the nostrils as if with bands
of steel, and penetrating to the innermost nerve with their pungent iciness.
No protection seemed of any avail. The whole surface of the body ached as
if it were laid against a slab of ice. The throat closed instinctively, and contracted
its unpleasant respiration. The body and limbs drew irresistibly together
to economize, like a hedge-hog, the exposed surface. The hands
and feet felt transmuted to lead; and across the forehead, below the pressure
of the cap, there was a binding and oppressive ache, as if a bar of frosty
iron had been let into the skull. The mind, meantime, seemed freezing up,—unwillingness
to stir, and inability to think of anything but the cold, becoming
every instant more decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the bend of the valley our difficulties became more serious. The
drifts often lay across the road like a wall, some feet above the heads of the
horses; and we had dug through one or two, and had been once upset, and
often near it, before we came to the steepest part of the ascent. The horses
had by this time begun to feel the excitement of the rum given them by the
driver at the last halt, and bounded on through the snow with continuous
leaps, jerking the sleigh after them with a violence that threatened momently
to break the traces. The steam from their bodies froze instantly, and covered
them with a coat like hoar-frost; and spite of their heat, and the unnatural
and violent exertions they were making, it was evident by the pricking of
their ears and the sudden crouch of the body when a stronger blast swept
over, that the cold struck through even their hot and intoxicated blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We toiled up, leap after leap; and it seemed miraculous to me that the
now infuriated animals did not burst a blood-vessel or crack a sinew with
every one of those terrible springs. The sleigh plunged on after them, stopping
dead and short at every other moment, and reeling over the heavy drifts
like a boat in a surging sea. A finer crystallization had meanwhile taken
place upon the surface of the moist snow; and the powdered particles flew
almost insensibly on the blasts of wind, filling the eyes and hair, and cutting
the skin with a sensation like the touch of needle-points. The driver and
his maddened but almost exhausted team were blinded by the glittering and
whirling eddies; the cold grew intenser every moment, the forward motion
gradually less and less; and when, with the very last effort apparently, we
reached a spot on the summit of the hill which from its exposed situation
had been kept bare by the wind, the patient and persevering whip brought
his horses to a stand, and despaired, for the first time, of his prospects of
getting on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The description, which is too long to extract entire, details still severer
difficulties; after which the writer and driver mounted the leaders, and finally
arrived, nearly dead with cold, at the tavern. Such cold as is described here,
however, is what is called “an old-fashioned spell,” and occurs now but
seldom.</p>
